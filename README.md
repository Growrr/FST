#FST - A ZURB Foundation Starter Theme for WordPress

*Version 2.1*

**FST is a simple WordPress starter theme loaded with ZURB Foundation 5.5.1.**

[https://github.com/SimonPadbury/fst](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/fst)

This theme has been built for use as a starter theme and as a learning aid for people who wish to get into WordPress theme design.

**[MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)** (open source).

**Note:** in January 2015 this theme had a major re-build, bringing its base files in line with [BST](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/bst), my Bootstrap Starter Theme for WordPress. Now users of either theme will feel 'at home' in the other.

##Features of FST

1. **Simple, intuitive, clean code** – CSS, JS, functions, template includes and loops are organized into different folders.
2. **ZURB Foundation 5.5.1** – CSS and JS enqueued in `functions/enqueues.php`. 
3. **jQuery 2.1.3 enqueued** – from the `foundation/vendors/` folder.
4. **Foundation icon fonts included** – [http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3). These are used in various places throughout this theme. 
5. **Two WordPress menu positions in the Foundation top-bar** – left and right.
6. **Optional search form built into the top-bar**
7. **Foundation pagination for blog index and category pages**
8. **A starter CSS theme** – `css/fst.css` (**Don't** put your own styles in `style.css`.)
9. **Visual editor stylesheet** – into which the same Foundation and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.

##Customizing `foundation.css`

You can simply swap the default Foundation files (included) for a custom made Foundation CSS generated by the **customizer** ([http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html](http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html)), and this theme will still work. 

###Notes:

1. You will still need to include the button styles and form styles in the customized foundation.css build.
2. If in the customizer you change the humber of grid columns (from the default 12), you will need to adapt the grid layout in `404.php`, `category.php`, `index.php`, `page.php`, `single.php` and ``search.php`.

##Using SCSS

You will need to:

1. Get the *latest* Foundation SCSS files from [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html) and place them in a `scss/` folder in the root directory of this theme;
2. Set up your **pre-processor** so that it outputs your CSS files in the theme's `css/` folder;
3. Then you can modify `scss/foundation/_settings.css` and you can create your own `scss/fst.scss` file. **Note:** be sure to copy my original content of `css/fst.css` into your SCSS file before your pre-processor overwrites it.

Alternatively, you may prefer to combine all into one CSS file, by putting `@import "foundation/settings";` and `@import "foundation";` at the top of your *scss/fst.scss*. 

If you do this, then remember to remove the register and enqueue for "foundation.min.css" from `functions/enqueues.php` as it is no longer required. Also, you will then need to remove `@import url("foundation.min.css");` from `css/editor-style.css`.

##Make this theme your own

You can easily make this theme your own by following these steps:

1. Rename the root folder from `fst/` to `yourtheme/`.
2. Rename `css/fst.css` to `css/yourtheme.css`.
3. Rename `js/fst.js` to `js/yourtheme.js`.
4. In your code editor, do a global search-and-replace ("Replace in files...") to rename ... `fst` => `your-theme` – **everywhere in the theme's code**.
5. Modify the comments in style.css.

Do all that correctly, and this WordPress theme will still work!
