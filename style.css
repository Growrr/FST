NOTES
(1.) Your styles must not be put in here, but in css/app.css
(2.) You can add your styles directly into css/app.css â€“ or if you know SCSS, you can add your styles into scss/app.scss and compile app.css from there.
(3.) If you use app.css, you much go to functions/enqueues.php and comment out (or delete) the register and enqueue for 'foundation-stylesheet' because app.scss contains @import "foundation"
