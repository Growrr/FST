/*
Editor stylesheet
=================
In order to style the Tiny-MCE WYSIWYG editor to almost* resemble your website's front-end, you can: 

(1.) @import your stylesheet, and then
(2.) Add some CSS to improve your experience in the tiny-mce editor.

[* The only major difference is, the width of the editor is different to the width of your front-end blog/page entry.]

As a default, I have here imported the stylesheet 'foundation.css'. But if you are pre-processing from the SCSS files, and if you @import Foundation into your 'app.scss', then you may here import your 'app.css' instead of the 'foundation.css' (on line 12 below).

@import url('foundation.css');

	padding: 1rem !important;
